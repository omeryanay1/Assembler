# Assembler
Low-level programs written in symbolic machine language are called assembly programs.
Programmers rarely write programs directly in machine language. Rather, programmers who
develop high-performance programs (e.g. system software, mission-critical apps, and software for
embedded systems) often inspect the assembly code generated by compilers. They do so in order
to understand how their high-level code is actually deployed to the hardware, and how that code
can be optimized for gaining better performance. One of the players in this process is the program
that translates code written in a symbolic machine language into code written in binary machine
language. This program is called an assembler.
